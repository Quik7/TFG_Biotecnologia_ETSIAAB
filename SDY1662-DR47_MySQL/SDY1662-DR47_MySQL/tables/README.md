# Tables

This directory contains the DDL to create the tables in the MySQL relational
database. The ../scripts/createResearchTables.sh uses the DDL in these file
to create the tables.

## Note
If a new table is added to the data model, you will need to add a new table
file in this directory, as well as updating the 
../scripts/createResearchTables.sh script.
