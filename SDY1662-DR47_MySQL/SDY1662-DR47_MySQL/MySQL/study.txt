However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York.~@~An Inflammatory Cytokine Signature Predicts Covid-19 Severity And Survival~@~N~@~\N~@~2~@~Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients.

We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.~@~2020-09-30 00:00:00~@~DR36~@~NA~@~2020-09-30 00:00:00~@~DR36~@~  89.00~@~    .00~@~In this study, we asked whether inflammatory cytokine levels can help predict disease course and outcome in COVID-19 patients. To enhance the relevance of the cytokine assays, we focused on four pathogenic cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b, with clinically available drugs to counteract them, and chose the ELLA microfluidics platform to rapidly measure them (within 3 hours), making these results potentially actionable.~@~An Inflammatory Cytokine Signature Predicts Covid-19 Severity And Survival~@~Y~@~NCI~@~1400~@~4875~@@~
