44~@~NIH ImmPort Share Active~@~Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) to characterize human immune responses/mechanisms elicited by vaccinations, adjuvants or natural infection by capitalizing on recent advances in immune profiling technologies. Measure the diversity and commonalities of human immune responses under a variety of conditions using high-throughput systems biology approaches coupled with detailed clinical phenotyping in well-characterized human cohorts. An additional goal of this program is to advance research by promoting rapid public access to HIPC-supported data and results through public portals such as ImmPort and ImmuneSpace, as well as the development of new methods for data integration, analysis, presentation, and visualization to further research and development in this field.
