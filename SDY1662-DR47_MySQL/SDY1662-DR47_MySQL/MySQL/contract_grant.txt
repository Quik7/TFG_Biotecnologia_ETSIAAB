3927~@~NIH~@~Human Immunology Project Consortium (DHIPC), will study the human immune responses 1) during or following dengue virus (DENV) infection, 2) before and after live attenuated DENV vaccination, using high-throughput systems biology approaches coupled with detailed clinical phenotyping in well-characterized human cohorts. The long-term goal is to develop molecular signatures that define immune response and categories/fingerprints/profiles that correlate with the outcome of infection and vaccination. We will use 'omics' technology platforms including genomics (Core B), RNAi screens (Project 3) and proteomics (Core C), and immune profiling (Core D) to study human cells from healthy donors (Project 3) and well characterized human cohorts of DENV infected children that include symptomatic versus non-symptomatic infections in dengue endemic areas (Project 1). We also include studies of live attenuated DENV vaccinations in humans (Project 2), to predict immunogenicity, and in the future correlate immune profiles determined before or soon after vaccination with protective efficacy, and also with adverse events triggered by vaccination. The data analysis and modeling core (Core E) will be the engine for translating omics data into biological insight and the data Management Dissemination Core (Core F) will act as a central repository for all data and resources generated by the Center, and ensure that these materials are readily accessible by not only other scientists in the program, but also the broader scientific community. The results of our proposed systems immunology studies will create a foundation for future hypothesis-driven research and may help develop diagnostic tools and define immune profiles correlated with outcomes of infection and vaccination. The Projects and Cores are overseen by an Administrative Core (Core A), which has an organizational structure for reporting and accountability to maintain scientific and fiscal flexibility and responsibility. Dengue disease is of great public health importance and our program has the unique opportunity to compare natural infections with live attenuated vaccines under clinical development both in vivo and ex vivo, building a new paradigm for studying other human infectious diseases in the settings of infection and vaccination. projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9100643~@~2021-05-31 00:00:00~@~AI118610~@~https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8929545&icde=27751550&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=11&csb=GNA&cs=ASC~@~Dengue Human Immunology Project Consortium (DHIPC MSSM)~@~44~@~2015-07-01 00:00:00~@@~
4881~@~NIH~@~Immunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new questions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential associated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the forefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate goal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists, and biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling datasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer immunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment biospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing approaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive array of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue the following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune changes during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic evaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate sharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care.~@~2022-06-30 00:00:00~@~CA224319~@~https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9457012~@~High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring Of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials~@~71~@~2017-09-30 00:00:00~@@~
